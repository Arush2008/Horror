```
VoidOS/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # All styling and animations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps.js            # App definitions and terminal commands
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js          # Main system functionality

## Browser Compatibility

VoidOS works best in modern browsers that support:
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- ES6 JavaScript features
- localStorage
- CSS animations and transforms

Tested on:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Development

The system is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maximum compatibility and performance. Each app is modular and can be easily extended or modified.

### Adding New Apps

1. Define the app in `apps.js` with title, icon, content, and styles
2. Add the app to the desktop icons and start menu in `index.html`
3. Implement app-specific functionality in the `initializeApp` method in `script.js`

### Customizing the Interface

- Colors and themes can be modified in `styles.css`
- Window behaviors are controlled in the VoidOS class
- App content and functionality are defined in `apps.js`
