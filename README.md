💻 VoidOS — A Glitchy Web-Based Operating System Experience

VoidOS is a fully in-browser fake operating system. It starts off clean and modern — like a retro-futuristic desktop — but the more you use it, the more it breaks. Windows stutter, commands glitch, UI elements bug out. It’s like your system is slowly falling apart... on purpose.

✨ What Can It Do?

VoidOS feels like a real OS in your browser. It’s got:

🖥️ Desktop Environment
A retro-inspired desktop with a gradient animated background
Draggable icons and a fully working taskbar
Start menu to launch built-in apps
Windows you can move, resize, minimize, or close
System tray with real-time clock and status
📦 Built-In Applications
VoidTerminal – A command-line terminal that lets you interact with the system
VoidBrowser – A fake browser that shows system info and uptime
Notes App – A basic text editor with auto-save and character count
File Explorer – A folder/file navigation UI with dummy files
Settings Panel – Allows the user to "customize" (but not really fix) things
⚙️ Core System Features
Local storage keeps your settings and session even if you refresh
Real-time system clock, uptime tracking, and session monitoring
Terminal supports interactive commands
Smooth transitions and retro-glitch effects that increase with use
Responsive layout for both desktop and mobile
Glitches get worse the more you interact with the system 😈
